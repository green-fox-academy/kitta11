# string.capwords(s, sep=None)Â¶
# Split the argument into words using str.split(), capitalize each word using str.capitalize(), 
# and join the capitalized words using str.join(). If the optional second argument sep is absent or None, 
# runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, 
# otherwise sep is used to split and join the words.
